# 2020 Stack Overflow Survey - Focus: Diversity

## Motivation
International Women’s Day 2021 again sparked many discussions about diversity and inclusion. Having just started the Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science, the day triggered me to investigate the status quo in the tech community. Following questions are tackled in the notebook:
  1. What is the demographic setup of today’s developer community? What profile is typical for a person writing code these days?
  2. How inclusive is the community? Do underrepresented groups feel equally welcome?
  3. Are there differences regarding compensation? Is there a gender pay gap?

## File Descriptions
- 2020_Stack_Overflow_Survey_Diversity.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook containg data analysis
- survey_results_public.csv # CSV file containing nearly 65,000 survey responses (1 respondent per row, 1 column per answer)
- survey_results_schema.csv # CSV file containing the questions that correspond to each column

## Required Installations
Python 3, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (best install Anaconda Package)

## Overview of Results
The analysis of the demographic setup shows that there is still a long way to go to achieve a truly diverse tech community. This regards all dimensions, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, but also age.
One way to encourage entering the field is an inclusive space for all. The Stack Overflow community, as the largest developer community globally however, is not faring too well for underrepresented groups and should strive to take more measures to ensure that everyone feels equally part of the community.
In one of the key areas, i.e. compensation, the status quo — at least in the USA for female developers entering the field or in their early career — already looks positive and the industry seems to have put measures in place to offer incentives to encourage more gender diversity.
